## Workshop: Fundamentals of High Performance Computing on Blanca

### Date: 
Wednesday, 14 October 2020, 9:30a-12:00p.

### Location: 
This course will be conducted remotely via Zoom. The Zoom URL will be sent to participants via email.

### Instructor 
Andrew Monaghan, Research Computing, University of Colorado

### Description: 
This tutorial will introduce you to the [Blanca](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/access/blanca.html) "condo" compute cluster at CU, which is managed by [CU Research Computing](https://www.colorado.edu/rc/) (RC). Your group has contributed a 32-core Intel Skylake compute node to Blanca. The node has a Tesla V100 GPU onboard. You have priority access to this compute node, in addition to preemptable access to an additional 200 compute nodes. 

### Agenda
* Overview of Blanca
* Basic [Linux/Unix commands](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/)
* [Logging into RC](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/access/logging-in.html) 
* [Software modules](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compute/modules.html)
* [Submitting jobs on Blanca](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/access/blanca.html#examples). 

_Special emphasis will be placed on the use of python and Matlab on Blanca._

### Prerequisites: 

1) Sign up for a [Research Computing account](https://rcamp.rc.colorado.edu/accounts/account-request/create/verify/ucb).  _(Note: when responding to the question "Why are you requesting an account?", you can select the final option, "My research group has purchased condo nodes"). __Please sign up for your account at least 2 days in advance of the workshop__  

2) Send an email requesting to be added to the blanca-papp partition to rc-help@colorado.edu and carbon copy David.Carlson@colorado.edu.

3) Make sure your laptop or desktop has a Secure Shell (SSH) client software installed.  If you have Mac OS, this is already installed (via the "Terminal" application).  If you have Windows, there are many options such as [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org) and [GitBASH](https://gitforwindows.org).
